    <blockquote>So come now, tell me this,<br>
        and speak out candidly—Whose slave are you?<br>
        Whose orchard are you tending? And tell me<br>
        the truth about this, too, so I understand—<br>
        Is this place we’ve reached really Ithaca,<br>
        as some man I just met on my way here<br>
        told me.  </blockquote>
        (HOMER trans. Ian Johnston, Odyssey Book 24)
    <blockquote>And if you find her poor, Ithaca has not deceived you. <br>
      Wise as you have become, with so much experience, <br>
      you must already have understood what these Ithacas mean.</blockquote> 
      (C.P. CAVAFY trans. EDMUND KEELEY, Ithaka)
    <blockquote><em>Was there one point on which their views were equal and negative?</em> <br>
        The influence of gaslight or electric light on the growth of adjoining paraheliotropic trees.</blockquote> 
        (JAMES JOYCE, Ulysses - Ch. 17: Ithaca)</h3>
